# Vet's Proper Age Checker
The PROPER age-verifying script that everyone fears.

STATUS: Not Completed

This'll be a single JS file that implements a more child-proof age vertification, far more successful in filtering out those under 13 (or under 16) from viewing your website, free to modify for your purposes. All you need to do is download the script onto your website via FTP and insert one line of code into each of your webpages. Users will have to answer questions about technology from before 2003 in this script.

This script is made to directly address issues like COPPA violations by (and while):
* Not using cookies or other trackers.
* Not using PHP or serverside (Important for websites that aren't allowed or permitted to perform server-side activites.)
* Not recording ANY data other than if the user answered the question correctly or not.
* Not storing ANY data, not even that the user answered the question correctly or not.

It's going to be annoying, but it'll work.
